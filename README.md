After analyzing 3000 random player I came to knowledge that there's a big amount of
Vayne,Thresh,Lee Sin and Jinx mains. So I though I could make some
small minigames to make them improve! Well that's the concept. I'm not really 
good enough with these champions to make proper learning games,but I still hope
you enjoy them.
